Thank you for completing this introductory course on Gazebo and RoboMaker!

Resources are listed below to continue your learning journey.

## Next courses
Now that we have a brief of Gazebo, we know how to set up the environment to test some robot application. The next step for developing more complex applications is to learn how to use other packages that will make the robot fully autonomous, which will be covered in the immediate next course as part of this curriculum, Course 4: Developing Robot Applications. That course will allow you to become familiar with common packages used for wheeled ground robots.
