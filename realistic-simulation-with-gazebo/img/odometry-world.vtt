00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.080
This short video shows the odometry based&nbsp;
on the robot pose in the simulated world.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.360
This is not realistic, as, when the wheels&nbsp;
start spinning with the robot stuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.400
the pose of the robot remains the same.
