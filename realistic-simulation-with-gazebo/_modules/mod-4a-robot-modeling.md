What if we wanted to modify the robot, for example adding new sensors?

- the physical design.
- the sensor configuration.

In this module we will focus on the sensor configuration with a brief overview on the physical design of the robot.

Let's see in the [next unit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _modules/mod-4b-urdf.md %}) the main elements to modify the robot.
