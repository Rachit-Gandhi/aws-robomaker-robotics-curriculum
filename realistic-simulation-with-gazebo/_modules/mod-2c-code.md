The implementation relies on a popular library for image processing and computer vision, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). The code can be found at the following git repository:
[https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros/blob/main/src/aws_example_apps/line_following/nodes/line_following](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros/blob/main/src/aws_example_apps/line_following/nodes/line_following)

Here the code that will be discussed in this unit.

We will highlight the lines of code that are new compared to those seen in Course 2.

-----
```
image = self.bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(msg, desired_encoding='bgr8')
```
allows for converting a [ROS image message](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html) to a 2D array (in `numpy`).

-----
```
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
# find only pixels those withing the HSV range.
mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, self.color_range[0], self.color_range[1])
```
This is the main part of the image processing algorithm, i.e., the conversion to HSV and masking the image considering only those that are in the "green range".

-----
```
height, self.width, channels = image.shape
top_window = int(height * TOP_WINDOW)
bottom_window = int(height * BOTTOM_WINDOW)
mask[0:top_window, :] = 0
mask[bottom_window:height, :] = 0

# Find the centroid based on moment.
M = cv2.moments(mask)
if M['m00'] > 0:
    centroid_x = int(M['m10']/M['m00'])
    centroid_y = int(M['m01']/M['m00'])
```
Then, only the bottom part of the image is considered and the centroid is found, through the image moments. This information is used by the controller to send angular velocities, depending on the error. The error is multiplied by `P_GAIN`, which clamps the possible error values within the maximum angular velocity. A value of 0.01 was chosen and worked well experimentally.

While the command could be sent within the image callback, the command is sent within the main loop, so that a maximum rate to send control commands is satisfied. This will allow also for a combination of behaviors â€“ e.g., stop the robot if there is an obstacle in front, as a finite state machine.

------

Here the commands to set up the necessary packages (assuming that `ros_workspace` was existing already):

```
cd ~/ros_workspace/src/
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros
cd aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh

```

**Reminder:** if using the AWS RoboMaker development environment, open the Virtual Desktop by clicking the virtual desktop button in the top navigation tool bar. This will open a pop-up window, if you are prompted, allow your browser to open the pop-up window. In the terminal of the IDE, set the display to the virtual desktop:

```
export DISPLAY=:0
```

Next, we will build the ROS application to run in the simulation. Note: every time you make a code change to the ROS packages in this sample repository, you will need to run this command

```
cd ~/environment/aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros
colcon build
```

To run the simulation first ensure you are in the base workspace directory and the application is sourced.

```
cd ~/environment/aws-robomaker-jetbot-ros
source install/setup.sh

#launch simulation
roslaunch line_following line_following_sim.launch
```

This will result in the following behavior.
