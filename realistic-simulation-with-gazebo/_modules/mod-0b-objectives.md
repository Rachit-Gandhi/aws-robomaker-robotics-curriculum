How do you set up a simulator to enable robotics software development?
This course will give you the **basics in Gazebo** to build a simulation and test robotics software: 
1. First, we will delve into the sensor characteristics that are simulated in Gazebo.
2. Second, we will develop an application for a wheeled robot based on camera images and test it in Gazebo. 
3. We will learn how to model a simulated world.
4. We will also get an overview on robot modeling. 
5. Lastly, we will look at how simulation can be used beyond testing, for learning approaches. 

Each module is composed of a number of videos, readings, simple examples, and tests to facilitate the conceptual understanding. This course is not meant to provide full technical details, which would require longer and separate courses; interested students are encouraged to explore the additional resources provided throughout the course and at the end.


By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Define the main characteristics needed for a simulator.
- Create a simple world and robot models in Gazebo.
- Write code that interacts with the simulator.
- Set up a reinforcement learning system based on the simulation.
