With the basics on Gazebo and robot modeling, the last task is working on a project that integrates all the different components. In particular, the requirements are as follows:
1. Modify the track environment.
2. Add obstacle walls to the track environment.
3. Integrate the behavior of following the lane, together with obstacle avoidance.

The starting code that can be used is the same one used for following the line. The code can be run locally or on AWS RoboMaker.
