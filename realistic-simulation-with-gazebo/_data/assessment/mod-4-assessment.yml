   question: "Is high-fidelity of visual and collision always necessary for running the simulation?"
   items:
    - choice: Yes
      correct: false
      comment: It is not always the case, especially if computational resources are limited.
    - choice: No
      correct: true
      comment: Correct. Typically they are simplified for making the simulation using less resources.
