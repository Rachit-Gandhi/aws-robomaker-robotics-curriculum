   question: "Simulations cannot run faster than real time."
   items:
    - choice: True.
      correct: false
      comment: The real-time factor can be changed to run simulations faster, up to the limit of the computational power on the computer.
    - choice: False.
      correct: true
      comment: Correct! The real-time factor can be changed to run simulations faster, up to the limit of the computational power on the computer.

   question: "In stochastic simulations, when there are repeated runs, the result will always be the same."
   items:
    - choice: True.
      correct: false
      comment: Stochastic simulations mean that random variables are involved in the process, leading to different results.

   question: "When running a Gazebo simulation, only one process runs to simulate the physics and display the user interface to allow a user to interact with the simulation."
   items:
    - choice: True.
      correct: false
      comment: Gazebo has a server, which runs the code for simulating the physics and generating the sensor data, and a client that can be run by a user to interact and visualize the simulation.
    - choice: False.
      correct: true
      comment: Correct! Gazebo has a server, which runs the code for simulating the physics and generating the sensor data, and a client that can be run by a user to interact and visualize the simulation.

   items:
    - choice: True.
      correct: true
      comment: Correct!
    - choice: False.
      correct: false
      comment: The world contains the specifications about the global properties of the simulation, light, models, and plugin.
